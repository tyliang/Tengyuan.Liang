# Biography

I am an [assistant professor](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/l/tengyuan-liang) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu). I use principles from [learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory) and [mathematical statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_statistics) to understand models and data.

My research is supported by the NSF CAREER Award and the George C. Tiao Faculty Fellowship.  My current research aims to:

- bridge the empirical and theoretical gap in modern statistical learning;
- understand the computational and algorithmic aspects of statistical inference;
- explore the role of stochasticity in solving non-convex optimization.
