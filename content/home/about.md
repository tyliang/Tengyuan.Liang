# Biography

I am a [Professor](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/l/tengyuan-liang) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu), Booth School of Business. I use principles from [Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory) and [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_statistics) to understand models and data.

My research is supported by the NSF CAREER grant and the William Ladany faculty fellowship. My current research aims to:

- bridge the empirical and theoretical gap in modern statistical learning;
- understand optimization and inference of infinite-dimensional models;
- explore the role of stochasticity in solving non-convex optimization.
